Hi ,

I’d like to enhance our existing data visualization web app by adding two new visualizations  Below are the details and requirements for each visualization:

------------------------------------------------------
**1. Tree Diagram**

**Objective:**  
Display a hierarchical representation of key mental health aspects in our dataset.

**Structure:**  
- **Root Node:** “Mental Health” (a conceptual aggregation)
- **Child Nodes:**  
  - **Diagnosis:** Use the “Diagnosis” column to denote whether an employee is diagnosed (e.g., Yes/No)  
  - **Treatment:** Use the “Sought Treatment” column indicating if treatment was sought  
  - **Workplace:** Use the “Responsible Employer” column to display whether the employer supports mental health (e.g., Supportive/Not Supportive)

**Optional Details:**  
- If possible, include additional contextual information from columns like “Company Size” or “Age-Group” to further refine the hierarchy.

**Required List of Columns for Tree Diagram:**  
- Diagnosis  
- Sought Treatment  
- Responsible Employer  
- *(Optionally: Company Size, Age-Group)*

------------------------------------------------------
**2. Network Graph**

**Objective:**  
Display a network visualization that shows interrelationships among high-level mental health variables without embedding binary or leaf-level responses.

**Nodes (Variables):**  
- Family History of Mental Illness  
- Sought Treatment  
- Diagnosis  
- Discuss Mental Health Problems  
- Responsible Employer

**Relationships (Edges):**  
- The graph should infer potential links such as:
  - Link “Family History of Mental Illness” to “Sought Treatment”  
  - Link “Sought Treatment” to “Diagnosis”  
  - Link “Diagnosis” to “Discuss Mental Health Problems”  
  - Link “Discuss Mental Health Problems” to “Responsible Employer”

**Required List of Columns for Network Graph:**  
- Family History of Mental Illness  
- Sought Treatment  
- Diagnosis  
- Discuss Mental Health Problems  
- Responsible Employer
